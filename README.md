### How to Play the Game

The game board consists of sixteen to forty cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight to twenty pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

At start player chooses a level:

- "easy" has 8 pairs of cards
- "medium" has 15 pairs of cards
- "hard" has 20 pairs of cards

On each turn:

- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
- If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
